# Hacker101 CTF Write-Up

## Level 1: Flag 0

#### Vulnerability: Unprotected private page.

This level involves a very simple, and insecure, CMS application. Again, Firefox is set up to proxy all requests through Burp Suite Community Edition.

For the first flag you need to have an understanding of how the pages for the site are indexed. Navigating around the site, I can see that the user created pages have urls that look like `http://35.227.24.107/011a072615/page/2` There are only two pages in the list on the homepage, and they are `/page/1` and `/page/2/`. I tried `/page/3` and got a 404 response indicating that the url did not map to a valid page.

I tried a few more page numbers, and all returned 404, except for `/page/6`, which returned a 403 Forbidden response. This indicates that there's a page there, but it's protected.

I knew that the other pages each have an edit page with a url like `http://35.227.24.107/011a072615/page/edit/2`. Using this format, I tried to visit the edit page for the protected page...

And there's the flag!
