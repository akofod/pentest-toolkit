# Hacker101 CTF Write-Up

## Level 1: Flag 2

#### Vulnerability: SQL Injection

This level involves a very simple, and insecure, CMS application. Again, Firefox is set up to proxy all requests through Burp Suite Community Edition.

For the second flag, I had to use several of the hints provided. It started with the hint that form fields aren't the only inputs from a browser. And the question "Have you tested for the usual culprits? XSS, SQL injection, path injection?"

I had tested the inputs for everything, but it's possible that the url was somehow working as an input.

I tried adding a `'` to the end of the url on an edit page, and that did the trick!

![Level 1, Flag 2 - SQLi in url](../../images/hacker101/lvl1flg1_1.png)

This seems to be a SQL Injection vulnerability. I can't tell for sure, but it seems that the page number value in the url is being used in the SQL statement that is used to update the page.
