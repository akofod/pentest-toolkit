# Hacker101 CTF Write-Up

## Level 0: Flag 0

#### Vulnerability: Exposed data

This is a pretty simple one. To start with, I have Firefox setup to proxy all requests through Burp Suite Community Edition.

Navigating to the challenge website shows two requests sent. One for the page html, and a second request for an image called background.png.

Examining the response for this second request in Burp, the flag is obvious.
