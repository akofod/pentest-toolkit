## Useful payloads for finding and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities

`'`  
Check for vulnerability to SQL injection. Look at response for anything that indicates an error may have been caused by this input.

`'OR''='`  
Enter in both username and password fields. May cause first user to be logged in, but will not reveal password.

`' OR '1'='1`  
Force target SELECT statement to return true. May work when only one field is being checked, or if only one field is unknown. For example, if username is known, may force password query to execute as true.  
 (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='tom' and password='' or '1'='1'`)

`' or LENGTH(password) = x#`  
May find the length of a password when boolean result can be seen (ie. if a different error message is displayed for username or password errors.)  
(`SELECT password FROM admins WHERE username=' ' or LENGTH(password) = x#`)
